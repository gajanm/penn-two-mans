Create a beautiful, warm, and inviting double-dating web application for University of Pennsylvania students. The app should feel fun, welcoming, and romantic while maintaining a sophisticated aesthetic that reflects both Philadelphia's charm and UPenn's culture.

CORE FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY

1. Authentication System
Restrict registration and login to @upenn.edu email addresses only with email verification required, secure password authentication, "Remember me" functionality, and proper session management.

2. User Profile & Survey System
Create a comprehensive profile and compatibility survey covering: Basic Info (age, gender, gender preference for dating), Religion & Spirituality (religious affiliation, importance of faith, spiritual practices), Core Values (what matters most like family, career, adventure, stability, creativity), Lifestyle (social habits, activity level, interests, hobbies, study habits), Emotional Style (communication preferences, conflict resolution, emotional expression), Partnership & Intimacy Style (relationship goals, love languages, boundaries, expectations), and Civics & Ethics (political leanings, social causes, ethical priorities).

3. Partner Selection System
Users select one same-gender friend as their "double-date partner" for the week. Partners can be changed weekly. Build a visual interface showing friends list and partner selection with smooth interactions.

4. Matching Algorithm
Implement a sophisticated matching system based on value alignment research (shared core values weighted heavily), Big Five personality compatibility (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism), social psychology principles for romantic compatibility, and complementary vs. similar trait balancing. Generate one 2-person pair match per week for each partnership with matches released every Tuesday.

5. Group Chat & Date Planning
Built-in group chat for all 4 matched individuals with icebreaker prompts and conversation starters. Date suggestion system that analyzes all 4 people's preferences with curated Philadelphia date ideas (restaurants, activities, venues, events). Include date confirmation and scheduling tools.

6. Philadelphia Integration
Real Philadelphia location recommendations with filters for budget, vibe, and distance from campus. Integration with Philly events and seasonal activities.
